I am writing to you in regards to the Product Program Director that you are currently advertising on LinkedIn.

I have extensive experience in PMO processes, product development, client relationships, product roadmaps and have managed software development projects and portfolios for Fortune 50 companies. 

I have specific experience in Agile implementations and projects and I am a technical problem solver that can work and solve technical or process issues..

Not only do I have this experience, I am an exceptional communicator bringing both my project/change and continuous improvement experience to bear.

It would be a privilege to join your team. Thank you for your consideration, and I hope to continue the conversation soon.

Regards,

Mark Cichonski
